[Chorus]
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me

[Verse 1]
Isolation
Trepidation
Don't fear nothing
Snake is bluffing
Whips his tail
Sends you running

[Chorus]
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me

[Verse 2]
Vegetation
Aggravation
Found him hiding
Snake is smiling
Whips his tail
Leaves you riling

[Chorus]
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me

[Refrain]
Rattle, rattle rattle
Rattle, rattle rattle
Rattle, rattle rattle

[Verse 3]
Hibernation
Altercation
Don't get angry
Snake is cranky
Whips his tail
In a frenzy

[Chorus]
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me

[Refrain]
Rattle, rattle, rattle
Rattle, rattle, rattle
Rattle, rattle, rattle

[Bridge]
I'm the serpent
Devil's servant
Time to meet your end
Fangs are ready for the strike
Deadly razor sharp
Poison with a single spike
While you're immobile
Screaming like a maniac after my attack
Crying like a baby child in exile
Sweat drips out of every pore as
I bite you more and more and more and
Take one last look at your captor
And hear my tail rattling 'til your death
Rattling 'til your death
[Refrain]
Rattle, rattle rattle
Rattle, rattle, rattle

Crying like a baby child
